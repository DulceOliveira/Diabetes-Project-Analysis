# Diabetes-Project-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis that i did for the final project for the Ironhack Bootcamp, focused on diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. 
The project intend to predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on a variety of health and lifestyle factors. 
The following sections provide an overview of the project's components and key findings.

 Its primary focus was to create a practical tool for predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes. 
 This involved a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing health and lifestyle data.
 The heart of the project layd in developing a machine learning model. 
 This model was trained on historical data to provide accurate predictions of diabetes risk.

## Project Goals

- To develop a data-driven solution for accurate diabetes prediction.
- To apply machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to gain insights.
- To create an accessible and engaging tool for diabetes risk assessment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned, and missing values were handled to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extensive EDA was performed to understand the data, visualize patterns, and identify potential relationships.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A machine learning model was trained using historical data to predict diabetes risk.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web application was developed to input user data and obtain risk predictions.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations were created to communicate insights and model performance.

## Resources that I used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Pickle
- Streamlit (for the web application)

Looking ahead, there is room for growth. Expanding the dataset, optimizing the application, 
and dive deeper into model interpretability.
